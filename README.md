# Project49

This is the read me file

git clone https://github.com/jpats523/Project49.git

There is a scripts folder - this is the installer that you run first once you pull down from github
The installations include
-main update/updgrade
-wiringPi
-picam

There is a programming folder that will hold all of the C programming that is needed to run the program

I also want to have a script (to be developed) that will set up the autorunning of the program
-needs to compile the C program
-adds the file to the area so it runs on boot
